# MachineLearning
This is a project I have written for the purpose of revising and learning concepts in Machine Learning.

I have started with a Logistic Regression Classifier for NLP Sentiment Analysis.

The Python script 'imdb_sentiment_analysis.py' in the main directory is an example of how to use the ml package to train and test the Logistic Regression classifier. 

To use this script, the directory paths can be modified to point to your own training and testing data, or if you wish to use it as is you can follow these steps to get the Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0:
1. Go to https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
2. Click on 'Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0' to download the file aclImdb_v1(1).tar.gz
3. Move this file to the same directory as the ml package and the imdb_sentiment_analysis.py script
4. Extract the .tar file, and then extract the aclImdb directory from the .tar file.
5. Run the script 'imdb_sentiment_analysis.py'
